Hadley Wickham (chief data scientist at RStudio and author of many amazing R packages you’ll be using) made this wise observation:\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\nIf you’re finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions in Slack, and try it again later.\nI promise, you can do this!",

Quizzes are low-stakes - your worst one is dropped, and the rest count for a small portion of your final grade. If you do poorly on one or two, use that as feedback on where you need additional improvement.\n\nWhy quiz at all? Research shows that giving small quizzes throughout a class can dramatically help with retention. It’s a phenomenon known as the “retrieval effect” - basically, you have to practice remembering things, otherwise your brain won’t remember them.

Yes, I’m 100% serious.\nWhy tho? Not being able to touch type can be a real hindrance when it comes to using a computer, and it’s especially important in a coding class where we will be typing a lot. Improving your typing speed and accuracy will not only improve your coding productivity, but also your productivity with pretty much everything else you do on a computer (like writing). By putting this challenge in place, my goal is that you will spend a little time practicing your typing.\nHow can I get better at typing? I recommend using keybr.com and setting ~60 words per minute as a reasonable target (~90 if you want to beat Professor Helveston). It’s well worth the effort, and if you spend a little time each day you’ll see improvement. Consistency is more important than length of time in any one practice session. Also, if you create an account and track your typing progress, I’ll also consider your progress for the challenge. That is, even if you lose the challenge but can demonstrate significant progress in your typing speed, I’ll take that into consideration as to whether to award you the bonus.",

Wherever the line is drawn, there will always be students just below or just above, and rounding will only move that bar and create another group of students who are just below and just above. Rounding does not eliminate the issue but rather just shifts it to another group of students. This is why I draw the lines before the course starts - to ensure a fair and transparent system for everyone, that way you don’t have to shoot for a moving bar. To be clear, this means I will not modify or round your final score, even if you’re very close to a different letter grade (e.g., a 93.98 is an “A-” and will not be rounded up to an “A”).\nRather than round, I grade generously throughout the semester. For example, if you give a quiz your best shot and completely fail it, you will likely get a 50% instead of a 0%. The 50% is for trying as there’s still some learning that happens when you try (0s are reserved for those who simply don’t take it).",

    "text": "Collaboration Policy\n\nLearning how to program is like learning how to ride a bicycle - to get better, you must practice writing code yourself. Therefore, we have a set of strict rules regarding what kind of collaboration is allowed, what counts as over-collaboration, and what counts as cheating.\n\nGood Collaboration\n\nDiscussing which general concepts might be useful in solving a problem (conditionals, loops, etc.).\nAsking for debugging help with code.\nSketch out algorithms on a whiteboard together.\nTo avoid copying the code, you should write up the solution together, discuss it, then erase the solution, wait a few minutes, and write up solutions individually.\nHelp each other debug specific parts of assignment code.\nGeneral discussion of course concepts.\nDetailed explanations of example code on the course website.\nCollaboratively solving a practice problem, with any level of co-writing code and co-debugging.\n\n\n\nOver-collaboration\nOver-collaboration results in a warning on the first offense, and a penalty on later offenses. Examples include:\n\nExplaining to a friend how to solve a problem in high-level terms by going through your own program line-by-line.\nHelping a friend debug code by suggesting they use your own approach to the problem.\nCollaborating with a student on an assignment and then not including their name as a collaborator in the assignment writeup.\nIn the case that you have taken this course before, copying your own code from the previous time you took the course.\n\n\n\nCheating\nCheating results in a penalty on the first offense, and failing the course on the second offense. Cheating on assignments can include:\n\nCopying or stealing any amount of code from someone currently in the class or someone who has taken the class before. Copying is never okay, whether the code is provided electronically, visually, audibly, or on paper.\nProviding code you have written for an assignment to anyone else in the class.\nFinding code online and using it in the assignment (one exception: you may use code from the course website).\nPutting code solutions from the course assignments online.\nReceiving code-level assistance from someone or something not associated with the course.\nGetting someone else to write the assignment code for you.\nAsking questions about the assignments on any online services outside of the course office hours or slack.\n\nCheating on quizzes, assignments, or the final project can include:\n\nReferring to any external resources while completing the assignment (phones, notes, etc.).\nCopying part of an answer off of another student’s paper, even if it is very small.\nUsing solutions provided by students who previously took the course.\n\n\n\nUse of chatGPT and other AI tools\nLarge language models (LLMs) are capable of producing exact solutions to many of the coding problems assigned in this class. That means we all basically have a solutions manual available for free.\nWith this in mind, the use of AI is permitted as follows:\n\nAssignments 1-7: AI tools are not permitted unless explicitly instructed. Copying code from an AI tool and submitting it as your own for these assignments will be considered cheating. In this section of the course, we are building foundational skills in computational thinking and problem solving. If you don’t master these skills, you won’t be able to interpret what chatGPT is giving you, and you won’t be able to test if it is wrong. Master these skills first - it is worth the effort.\nAssignments 8-13: AI tools are permitted, with caveats. If you do use an AI tool on these assignments, you must include a link to the chat conversation you had to receive full credit.\n\nLearn to use tools like ChatGPT as a learning assistant - a tool to help you accomplish the task - rather than just a solutions manual. One version of using it makes you a better and more efficient coder, the other robs you of that.\nIn the follow-on course to this one (EMSE 4572: Exploratory Data Analysis), the use of AI will be allowed to support your projects.\n\n\nPenalties\nViolations will be reported to the Office of Student Rights & Responsibilities. Penalties are decided by the course instructors, and can vary based on the severity of the offense. Possible penalties include:\n\nReceiving a 0 on the assignment/quiz in question.\nReceiving a full letter grade deduction in the course.\nAutomatically failing the course.\n\nDepending on the student’s prior academic history, violations may also be accompanied by a letter to the Dean of Student Affairs, again at the instructors’ discretion. This can lead to university-level penalties, such as being suspended or expelled.\n\n\nPlagiarism Detection\nPrograms are naturally structured, which makes them very easy to compare for plagiarism. Automated plagiarism detection systems make this process even easier. Watch this video showing plagiarism detection software in action (this example is using Python code, but this also works for R code).\nIn short, if you copy code, we will know - don’t copy code!\n\n\nGrace Period\nCollege is a time when you do a lot of learning. Sometimes, you might make bad decisions or mistakes. The most important thing for you to do is to learn from your mistakes, to constantly grow, and become a better person.\nSometimes, students panic and copy code right before the deadline, then regret what they did afterwards. Therefore, you may rescind any homework submission for up to 24 hours after the deadline with no questions asked. Simply email the course instructors asking to delete the submission in question, and we will do so. Deleted submissions will not be considered during plagiarism detection, though of course they will also not be graded. However, it will always be better to get a 0 (or partial credit) on an assignment than to get a cheating violation!",

    "text": "EMSE 4571 / 6571Intro to Programming for AnalyticsSpring 2024\n\n\n\n\n\nDepartment: Engineering Management and Systems Engineering @ GWU\nCredits: 3\nDescription:\nThis course provides a foundation in programming for analytics using the R programming language with a comparison to Python. Topics covered include fundamentals of programming (operators, data types, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, strings, testing, and debugging) as well as techniques for working with data sets in R and Python (file input/output, data structures, data wrangling, data visualization, external packages, and reproducible reporting). Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to develop skills in computational problem solving, writing code, and working with data. Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.\nLearning Objectives:\nHaving successfully completed this course, students will be able to:\n\nDevelop simple programs to effectively solve medium-sized tasks by:\n\nEmploying modular, top-down design in program construction.\nPro-actively creating and writing test cases to test and debug code.\nApplying computational problem-solving skills to new problems.\n\nWrite clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code for working with data using:\n\nSequential, conditional, and loop statements.\nNumeric, string, and logical data types.\nData structures, including lists, vectors, and data frames.\n\nReproducibly import, export, manipulate, and visualize data.\n\nPrerequisites:\nThere are no prerequisites. Students are assumed to have zero prior programming experience for this course.\n\n\n\n:::",

The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:\n\n0% for not attempting a response.\n50% for attempting the question but with major errors.\n75% for attempting the question but with minor errors.\n100% for correctly answering the question.\n\nThe reflection portion is always worth 10% and graded for completion.\nRules:\n\nProblems marked SOLO may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.\nFor problems marked COLLABORATIVE, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work – everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions.\n\n\n\nReadings\nThe readings from the last week will serve as a helpful reference as you complete this assignment. You can review them here:\n\n\nConditionalsTesting & Debugging\n\n\n\nUsing the autograder\n\nYou can check your solutions to problems 2 - 7 by logging into the autograder and uploading your hw4.R file.\nThe file must be named hw4.R or it won’t work.\nYour user name is your netID, and your password is inside the readme.txt file in the Box folder I shared with you.\n\n\n\n\n1) Staying organized [SOLO, 5%]\nDownload and use this template for your assignment. Inside the “hw4” folder, open and edit the R script called “hw4.R” and fill out your name, Net ID, and the names of anyone you worked with on this assignment.\n\nWriting test functions\nFor each of the following functions, write a test function first, and then write the function. Your test functions will count for half of the available credit for each problem. Think carefully about the test cases to include in your test functions.\n\n\n\n2) guessAnimal(hasFourLegs, climbsTrees) [SOLO, 10%]\nWrite the function guessAnimal(hasFourLegs, climbsTrees) that returns a statement guessing an animal based on whether it has four legs and whether it climbs trees. Here is the expected behavior:\n\n\n\n\nhasFourLegs\nclimbsTrees\nstatement\n\n\n\n\nTRUE\nTRUE\n“It’s probably a cat”\n\n\nTRUE\nFALSE\n“It’s probably a dog”\n\n\nFALSE\nTRUE\n“It’s probably a snake”\n\n\nFALSE\nFALSE\n“Hmm, I’m not sure”\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3) isPositiveMultipleOf4Or7(n) [SOLO, 15%]\nWrite the function isPositiveMultipleOf4Or7(n) that returns TRUE if n is a positive multiple of 4 or 7 and FALSE otherwise. Note than n could be any data type.\n\n\n4) isEvenPositiveInt(x) [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nGiven an arbitrary value x, return TRUE if it is an integer, and it is positive, and it is even (all 3 must be true), or FALSE otherwise. If the value x is not an integer, the function should return FALSE rather than error. So, isEvenPositiveInt(\"yikes!\") returns FALSE, and isEvenPositiveInt(123456) returns TRUE.\n\n\n5) isLeapYear(year) [SOLO, 20%]\nWrite the function isLeapYear(year) that returns TRUE if year is a leap year and FALSE otherwise. Assume that year is a positive integer.\n\n\n6) getTheCents(n) [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nWrite the function getTheCents(n) which takes a value n that represents a payment in US dollars and returns the number of cents in the payment. For example, if n is 2.45, the function should return 45. If n is an integer, the function should return 0, as it has 0 cents; if it isn’t a number, it should return NULL, because a non-number payment make no cents (ha!). If the payment has partial cents (for example, 3.953), it should be rounded to the nearest cent (in this case, 95 cents).\n\n\n7) Read and reflect [SOLO, 10%]\nRead and reflect on the following readings to preview what we will be covering next:\n\n\nIteration\n\n\nAfterwards, reflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?\nIn a comment (#) in your .R file, write at least a paragraph about your thoughts, and include at least one question. This can be on what you’ve learned and any questions or points of confusion you have about what we’ve covered thus far. This can be related to this assignment, next week’s readings, things going on in the world that remind you something from class, etc. If there’s anything that jumped out at you, write it down.\nSome thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nConnect the course content to your own work or projects you’re working on.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment, then submit your zip file on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n:::"

And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions.\n\n\n\nReadings\nThe readings from the last week will serve as a helpful reference as you complete this assignment. You can review them here:\n\n\nFunctions & Packages\n\n\n\n\n1) Staying organized [SOLO, 10%]\nJust like we did in HW1, we’re going to use an R project to keep everything in this assignment tidy. Create a new R project called “hw2” and save a new R script in it called “hw2.R”. Copy the following code to the top of this script and fill out your name, GW netID, and the names of anyone you worked with on this assignment:\n\n# Name:  Last, First\n# netID: Insert your netID here\n\n# I worked with the following classmates on this assignment:\n# 1) Name: Last, First\n# 2) Name: Last, First\n\nWrite your responses to all other questions in this assignment in your hw2.R file.\n\n\n2) Polya problem solving 1 [COLLABORATIVE, 15%]\nConsider the points A, B, and C defined by the following cartesian coordinates:\n\n\n\n\nPoint\nx\ny\n\n\n\n\nA\n1\n1\n\n\nB\n5\n1\n\n\nC\n5\n4\n\n\n\n\nYour task is to find out if the triangle formed by the points A, B, and C is a right triangle. Apply Polya’s problem solving technique:\n\nUnderstand the problem: In a code comment, write the question you are trying to solve in your own words, then create objects for each relevant piece of information provided in the problem statement.\nDevise a plan: In code comments, describe the steps you will take in your plan to solve the problem.\nCarry out the plan: Write code below your comments to carry out your plan.\nCheck your work: Examine your solution and any intermediate values you computed along the way. Do the values make sense (e.g. do you get negative numbers when you expected positive numbers)? Is there another way you could have solved it to check that you get the same result?\n\n\n\n3) Polya problem solving 2 [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nKevin is deciding between purchasing a Chevy Bolt, which sells for $29,390 (after subsidies), and a Toyota Camry, which sells for $24,000. The Bolt efficiency is 28 kWh of electricity per 100 miles while the Camry efficiency is 28 miles per gallon (mpg) on average. The average price of electricity (in DC, where Kevin lives) is $0.13 / kWh, and the average price of gasoline is $3.00 / gallon. Kevin drives 12,000 miles each year on average.\nTo help him make a decision about which car to buy, answer the following questions:\n\nHow long (in years) would he have to drive the Bolt for the money he saves in fuel savings to be greater than the price premium compared to the Camry?\nWhat would the price of gasoline need to be such that the fuel savings from driving the Bolt for 3 years would be greater than the price premium compared to the Camry?\nHow many miles would Kevin need to drive each year such that the fuel savings from driving the Bolt for 3 years would be greater than the price premium compared to the Camry?\n\nTo solve each problem, apply Polya’s problem solving technique:\n\nUnderstand the problem: In a code comment, write the question you are trying to solve in your own words, then create objects for each relevant piece of information provided in the problem statement.\nDevise a plan: In code comments, describe the steps you will take in your plan to solve the problem.\nCarry out the plan: Write code below your comments to carry out your plan.\nCheck your work: Examine your solution and any intermediate values you computed along the way. Do the values make sense (e.g. do you get negative numbers when you expected positive numbers)? Is there another way you could have solved it to check that you get the same result?\n\n\n\n4) Working with strings: the stringr package [SOLO, 15%]\nWho is your favorite super hero character? If you don’t already have one, pick one (mine is Professor Xavier, and no it’s not just because he’s a professor :P).\nIn your hw2.R file, create two objects that store the following character values:\n\nThe name of your favorite super hero.\nThe super power(s) your hero has.\n\nUse meaningful variable names to store these values.\nNext, install the stringr package. Try using the str_to_lower(), str_to_upper(), and str_to_title() functions from the stringr package on the objects you created. In a code comment, describe what these functions do.\nFinally, use the paste() function to merge your super hero’s name and power in a coherent sentence. For example, if the name is \"Professor Xavier\" and the the power is \"reads peoples' minds\", then a final sentence might be: \"Professor Xavier reads peoples' minds!\". (Note that I intentionally did not tell you how to use the paste() function…you’ll have to figure that one out)\n\n\n5) Installing packages from Github: the BRRR package [SOLO, 10%]\nThe vast majority of the time, you will install external packages using the install.packages() function. This installs packages from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN), where most packages are published. But you can also install packages that are under development or haven’t been published to CRAN yet. Most of the time, these packages are hosted on GitHub - an online platform for sharing code (it’s also where all of the files that make up this website are stored).\nTo install a package from GitHub, you first need to install the remotes package. Then you can use the remotes::install_github() function to install packages directly from GitHub. To try this out, install the remotes package, then trying installing the BRRR package:\n\nremotes::install_github(\"brooke-watson/BRRR\")\n\n\nNote: Packages on GitHub are in development and often require other packages to work. So if you get an installation error about some other package dependency, try restarting your R session and try again.\n\nNot sure what this package does? Well, one of the other nice things about packages listed on GitHub is the authors tend to write detailed descriptions - check out the GitHub page for the BRRR package. Then try using the BRRR::skrrrahh() function with different number arguments (turn your volume up). In the #hw channel on slack, post your favorite argument to skrrrahh() (mine is 24).\n\n\n6) Turtle practice [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nIn case you missed the intro to the TurtleGraphics package in class, go ahead and install and load the package. You might also want to review the related lesson page and the class slides. Then complete these tasks:\n\nLoad the TurtleGraphics package, then initiate your turtle with the turtle_init() function.\nRead through the following commands (don’t run them). In a code comment, type a description of what you think the turtle is going to do.\n\n\nturtle_init()\nturtle_move(distance = 25, direction = \"forward\")\nturtle_move(distance = 50, direction = \"backward\")\nturtle_reset()\nturtle_turn(angle = 90, direction = \"right\")\nturtle_move(distance = 25, direction = \"forward\")\nturtle_move(distance = 50, direction = \"backward\")\nturtle_reset()\n\n\nNow run the above commands to check if the turtle did what you expected. Congratulations, you’ve just practiced “code tracing”! Reading through code before running it then comparing the result with your expectation is an excellent method for improving your your computational thinking skills and your fluency with a particular language.\nUsing what you’ve learned about how to manipulate your turtle, write two different solutions for producing the following image (hint: the length of one side of the square is 50 units):\n\n\n\n\n\n\n7) Read and reflect [SOLO, 10%]\nRead and reflect on the following readings to preview what we will be covering next:\n\n\nCreating Functions\n\n\nAfterwards, reflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?\nIn a comment (#) in your .R file, write at least a paragraph about your thoughts, and include at least one question. This can be on what you’ve learned and any questions or points of confusion you have about what we’ve covered thus far. This can be related to this assignment, next week’s readings, things going on in the world that remind you something from class, etc. If there’s anything that jumped out at you, write it down.\nSome thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nConnect the course content to your own work or projects you’re working on.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment, then submit your zip file on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n:::"

    "text": "This course provides a foundation in programming for analytics using the R programming language with a comparison to Python. Topics covered include fundamentals of programming (operators, data types, objects, functions, conditionals, loops, strings, testing, and debugging) as well as techniques for working with data sets in R and Python (file input/output, data structures, data wrangling, data visualization, external packages, and reproducible reporting). Emphasis will be on producing clear, robust, and reasonably efficient code using top-down design, informal analysis, and effective testing and debugging. Students will primarily work on individual programming assignments to develop skills in computational problem solving, writing code, and working with data. Students will be assessed through quizzes, homework assignments, and exams. Teaching will involve interactive lectures with plenty of time spent live coding and working on practice problems in class. This course assumes no prior programming experience and is an ideal preparation for higher level courses in data analytics.\nThis course was inspired by many other courses / resources that cover similar material.

The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:\n\n0% for not attempting a response.\n50% for attempting the question but with major errors.\n75% for attempting the question but with minor errors.\n100% for correctly answering the question.\n\nThe reflection portion is always worth 10% and graded for completion.\nRules:\n\nProblems marked SOLO may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.\nFor problems marked COLLABORATIVE, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work – everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions.\n\n\n\nReadings\nThe readings from the last week will serve as a helpful reference as you complete this assignment. You can review them here:\n\n\nGetting StartedOperations & Data Types\n\n\n\n\n1) Class setup [SOLO, 10%]\nFor this class, you’ll need to install some software and register for some tools. You should have already done this, but in case you haven’t,go to the course software page to get set up.\nOnce you have joined the class slack, make a post to the #welcome channel introducing yourself - provide your name, year / program, and something interesting about yourself.\n\n\n2) Getting familiar with the course [SOLO, 10%]\nFollow Snoop’s advice and read the entire Course Syllabus (actually read the whole thing). Then review the schedule and make sure to note important upcoming deadlines.\n\n\n3) Staying organized [SOLO, 10%]\nOpen RStudio and create a new R project called “hw1” (see the reading for details on how to do this). Within your project, create a new R script (a “.R” file) and save it as “hw1.R”. When you save it, it should show up in the R project folder you just created. Finally, copy the following code to the top of this script and fill out your name, netID, and the names of anyone you worked with on this assignment (your netID is the part of your email address before \"@gwu.edu\"):\n\n# Name:  Last, First\n# netID: Insert your netID here\n\n# I worked with the following classmates on this assignment:\n# 1) Name: Last, First\n# 2) Name: Last, First\n\nWrite your responses to all other questions in this assignment in your R file.\n\n\n4) Objects & Operators: Converting Time [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nCreate objects to store each of the following two values - be sure to use meaningful variable names when creating your objects:\n\nThe number of seconds in a minute\nThe number of minutes in an hour\nThe number of hours in a day\nThe number of days in a typical year (not a leap year)\n\nNow, say you have another object called time_in_seconds that contains an integer number of seconds (for example, time_in_seconds &lt;- 8675309). Write code to convert the value stored in time_in_seconds into the units described below. Your solution may only use arithmetic operators and the objects you created (i.e. you may not use any numbers). You may also use the new objects you create in sequential order. For example, you may use the object created in part a) to create the object in part b), and so on.\n\nThe value of time_in_seconds in minutes\nThe value of time_in_seconds in hours\nThe value of time_in_seconds in days\nThe value of time_in_seconds in years\n\n\n\n5) Logical and relational operators [SOLO, 20%]\nConsider the following objects:\n\nw &lt;- FALSE\nx &lt;- TRUE\ny &lt;- FALSE\nz &lt;- TRUE\n\nWrite code to answer the following questions:\n\nWrite a statement with logical operators that compares the objects x, y, and z and returns TRUE\nWrite a statement with logical operators that compares the objects x, y, and z and returns FALSE\nFill in relational operators to make the following statement return TRUE:\n\n! (x __ y) & ! (z __ y)\n\nFill in relational operators to make this statement return FALSE:\n\n! (w __ y) | (z __ y)\n\n\n6) Data types [COLLABORATIVE, 20%]\nConsider the following objects:\n\nnumber    &lt;- typeof('3')\ncharacter &lt;- typeof(7)\nfalse     &lt;- typeof(\"FALSE\")\ntrue      &lt;- typeof(TRUE)\n\nWrite code to answer the following questions:\n\nWrite a statement with both relational & logical operators that compares the four objects number, character, false, and true and returns TRUE.\nWrite a statement with both relational & logical operators that compares the four objects number, character, false, and true and returns FALSE.\n\n\n\n7) Read and reflect [SOLO, 10%]\nRead and reflect on the following readings to preview what we will be covering next:\n\n\nFunctions & Packages\n\n\nAfterwards, reflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?\nIn a comment (#) in your .R file, write at least a paragraph about your thoughts, and include at least one question. This can be on what you’ve learned and any questions or points of confusion you have about what we’ve covered thus far. This can be related to this assignment, next week’s readings, things going on in the world that remind you something from class, etc. If there’s anything that jumped out at you, write it down.\nSome thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nConnect the course content to your own work or projects you’re working on.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment, then submit your zip file on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n:::"

The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:\n\n0% for not attempting a response.\n50% for attempting the question but with major errors.\n75% for attempting the question but with minor errors.\n100% for correctly answering the question.\n\nThe reflection portion is always worth 10% and graded for completion.\nRules:\n\nProblems marked SOLO may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.\nFor problems marked COLLABORATIVE, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work – everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions.\n\n\n\nReadings\nThe readings from the last week will serve as a helpful reference as you complete this assignment. You can review them here:\n\n\nCreating Functions\n\n\n\nUsing the autograder\n\nYou can check your solutions to problems 2 - 7 by logging into the autograder and uploading your hw3.R file.\nThe file must be named hw3.R or it won’t work.\nYour user name is your netID, and your password is inside the readme.txt file in the Box folder I shared with you.\n\n\n\n\n1) Staying organized [SOLO, 5%]\nAs always, we’re going to use an R project to keep everything in this assignment tidy. Download and use this template for your assignment. Inside the “hw3” folder, open and edit the R script called “hw3.R” and fill out your name, Net ID, and the names of anyone you worked with on this assignment.\n\n\n2) integerSquareRoot(n) [SOLO, 10%]\nGiven a non-negative integer n, return the integer value that is closest to its square root. For example, integerSquareRoot(10) returns 3.\n\n\n3) fabricYards(inches) [SOLO, 10%]\nFabric must be purchased in whole yards. Write a function that takes a non-negative number of inches of fabric desired, and returns the smallest number of whole yards of fabric that must be purchased. Thus, fabricYards(1) is 1 (you need a full yard if you buy one inch) and fabricYards(36) is also 1, but fabricYards(37) is 2. Hint: There are 36 inches in a yard!\n\n\n4) fabricExcess(inches) [SOLO, 10%]\nWrite a function that takes a non-negative number of inches of fabric desired and returns the number of inches of excess fabric that must be purchased (as purchases must be in whole yards). Thus, since you need a whole yard when you buy 1 inch, fabricExcess(1) is 35. Similarly, fabricExcess(36) is 0, and fabricExcess(37) is 35.\nHint: there are (at least) two good ways to write this. One way involves a simple expression using one of the math operators we have learned. The other way uses fabricYards(inches) (which you just wrote!).\n\n\n5) isPerfectCube(x) [SOLO, 15%]\nGiven an integer value x, returns TRUE if it is a perfect cube and FALSE otherwise. That is, return TRUE if there is another integer y such that x = y^3. Thus, isPerfectCube(27) returns TRUE, but isPerfectCube(16) returns FALSE.\n\n\n6) kthDigit(x, k) [COLLABORATIVE, 15%]\nGiven two integers, x and k, return the kth digit of x, counting from the right. So:\n\nkthDigit(789, 1) returns 9\nkthDigit(789, 2) returns 8\nkthDigit(789, 3) returns 7\nkthDigit(789, 4) returns 0\n\nNegative numbers should work, too, so kthDigit(-789, 1) returns 9.\n\n\n7) numberOfPoolBalls(rows) [COLLABORATIVE, 15%]\n\nPool balls are arranged in rows where the first row contains 1 pool ball and each row contains 1 more pool ball than the previous row. Thus, for example, 3 rows contain 6 total pool balls (1+2+3). With this in mind, write the function numberOfPoolBalls(rows) that takes a non-negative integer value (the number of rows) and returns another integer value (the number of pool balls in that number of full rows). For example, numberOfPoolBalls(3) returns 6. We will not limit our analysis to a “rack” of 15 balls; rather, our pool table can contain an unlimited number of rows. Hint: For this problem you should research Triangular Numbers.\n\n\n8) turtleSquare(s) [COLLABORATIVE, 10%]\n\nNote: Make sure your solutions for the remaining problem(s) are below the ignore_rest comment in your .R file (otherwise the autograder will run this code and it will be slow.\n\nWrite the function turtleSquare(s) which uses the TurtleGraphics package to draw a square with side length s &lt; 100 (because the turtle will “escape” the terrarium when s &gt;= 100). The square should be centered in the turtle’s terrarium, and your turtle should be placed in the center when done. Important: Do not put the turtle_init() command inside your function - the turtle should already be “initialized” inside the terrarium before calling your turtleSquare(s) function. For example, the code below produces a square with side length of 50:\n\nlibrary(TurtleGraphics)\nturtle_init()\nturtleSquare(50)\n\n\n\n\n9) Read and reflect [SOLO, 10%]\nRead and reflect on the following readings to preview what we will be covering next:\n\n\nConditionalsTesting & Debugging\n\n\nAfterwards, reflect on what you’ve learned while going through these readings and exercises. Is there anything that jumped out at you? Anything you found particularly interesting or confusing?\nIn a comment (#) in your .R file, write at least a paragraph about your thoughts, and include at least one question. This can be on what you’ve learned and any questions or points of confusion you have about what we’ve covered thus far. This can be related to this assignment, next week’s readings, things going on in the world that remind you something from class, etc. If there’s anything that jumped out at you, write it down.\nSome thoughts you may want to try in your reflection:\n\n“I used to think ______, now I think ______ 🤔”\nDiscuss some of the key insights or things you found interesting in the readings or recent class periods.\nConnect the course content to your own work or projects you’re working on.\n\n\n\nSubmit\nCreate a zip file of all the files in your R project folder for this assignment, then submit your zip file on the corresponding assignment submission on Blackboard.\n\n\n\nBonus: turtleTriangle(s) [SOLO, 3%]\nWrite the function turtleTriangle(s) which uses the TurtleGraphics package to draw an equilateral triangle with side length s &lt; 100. The triangle should be centered in the turtle’s terrarium, and your turtle should be placed in the center when done. Just like with turtleSquare(s), do not put the turtle_init() command inside your function - the turtle should already be “initialized” inside the terrarium before calling turtleTriangle(s). Hint: Getting the triangle centered is the tricky part - you may want to read more about equilateral triangles and apothems. The code below produces a triangle with side length of 50:\n\nlibrary(TurtleGraphics)\nturtle_init()\nturtleTriangle(50)\n\n\n\n:::"

The credit for each question will be assigned as follows:\n\n0% for not attempting a response.\n50% for attempting the question but with major errors.\n75% for attempting the question but with minor errors.\n100% for correctly answering the question.\n\nThe reflection portion is always worth 10% and graded for completion.\nRules:\n\nProblems marked SOLO may not be worked on with other classmates, though you may consult instructors for help.\nFor problems marked COLLABORATIVE, you may work in groups of up to 3 students who are in this course this semester. You may not split up the work – everyone must work on every problem. And you may not simply copy any code but rather truly work together and submit your own solutions."

After some thought, we see that no matter what number we start with, when we keep replacing the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, we’ll always either arrive at 4 (unhappy) or at 1 (happy). With that in mind, we want to write the function nthHappyNumber(n). However, to write that function, we’ll first need to write isHappyNumber(n), which determines whether a number is “happy” or not. And to right that function, we’ll first need to write sumOfSquaresOfDigits(n). And that’s top-down design! Here we go…"
